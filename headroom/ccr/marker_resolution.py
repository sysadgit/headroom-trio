"""Inline resolution of ``<<ccr:...>>`` markers on the response path.

Normal CCR resolution relies on the ``headroom_retrieve`` tool: a marker is
redeemed when the model calls the tool back. That path assumes there's a
subsequent turn in which the model *can* call it. Callers that never see an
injected tool at all — e.g. Headroom running as a LiteLLM guardrail/proxy hop
with no tool-call turn in between (#2509) — have no way to redeem a marker,
so it leaks through as raw text.

This module provides an explicit, opt-in fallback (``--ccr-inline-resolve``):
scan the outgoing response for markers and substitute the original content
directly, instead of leaving the marker for the model to redeem later.
