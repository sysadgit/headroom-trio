"""Session aggregation for the anonymous telemetry beacon.

One wide event per session, emitted when the session goes idle. Everything here
is off unless ``HEADROOM_TELEMETRY`` is explicitly on — see
:mod:`headroom.telemetry.beacon`.

# What counts as a session

A contiguous burst of proxy activity from one install, closed after
``IDLE_TIMEOUT_S`` of quiet. This is the web-analytics definition (GA uses a
30-minute inactivity window) and it is deliberately *not* keyed on conversation
content.

The alternative was to key sessions on
:func:`headroom.proxy.output_savings_policy.conversation_key_from_body`, which
is stable across the turns of one agent loop. That was rejected twice over:

* It is content-derived — a SHA256 over the first 512 chars of the first user
  message. Exporting it, even blinded, puts a function of the user's prompt on
  the wire. For a proxy whose entire promise is safe prompt handling, that is
  the wrong default, and defending it in a threat model costs more than the
  grouping is worth.
* ``RequestOutcome`` is built at 30 sites across six handlers, and the parsed
  body is not available at any shared chokepoint (the HTTP middleware sees
  headers only — see ``set_current_project`` at ``proxy/server.py``). Plumbing
  a conversation key to all of them is a large diff for a metric nobody has
  asked for yet.

Burst sessions serve every metric the beacon exists for: session count,
duration, turns, tokens saved per session, and retention. What they lose is
conversation *boundaries* — two concurrent conversations merge into one burst.
``turn_id`` is already on every outcome if conversation-level grouping is ever
needed; it can be added without changing this shape.

# Wire format

OTLP/HTTP JSON logs, POSTed straight to the collector. Deliberately *not* the
OTel logs SDK: that API is still ``opentelemetry.sdk._logs`` (underscore =
unstable), and the beacon should not break on an SDK minor bump. The OTLP JSON
wire format is a stable spec and plain stdlib gets us there.

The record body is an OTLP kvlist (not a JSON string) so the collector's
``keep_keys(body, [...])`` allowlist can introspect and drop unknown fields
server-side. That is the only control point for clients already in the wild.
